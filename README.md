**Uh-Oh, You need more stock immediately** That is where your department manager comes in  -  <br>
<br>

The "view low inventory" option shows all items in store with stock < **20 units**. This is done to ensure inventory is maintained: <br>

"Add to inventory" allows the manger to update stock as deliveries come in: <br>

In the example above, we can see that a hot new item was added to the cosmetics department! Now lets talk about managing departments -

#### Supervisor Interface 
Now this is the area for you or your buisness partner. This is where sales data is viewed and where to add whole new departments -
1. You will see the following options <br>
